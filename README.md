# BumpBot
 While exercise is crucial for physical and mental well-being, not all workouts are safe at every stage of pregnancy. I wanted to create a helpful tool that gives pregnant women real-time feedback on whether their posture during exercises is safe based on their trimester. That’s how BumpBot was born — a small step toward safer, smarter prenatal wellness.

 # What it does
 Allows users to select their trimester and exercise (Squats, Lunges, Bird Dog, Modified Side Plank)
 Uses your webcam to analyze posture in real-time
 Gives visual feedback if the exercise form is safe or risky
 Adjusts posture safety thresholds based on the user’s trimester
 Intuitive UI built with Streamlit for a friendly and inclusive user experience

 # Tech Stack
 Frontend/UI: Streamlit
 Computer Vision: OpenCV, MediaPipe Pose
 Language: Python
